    <!-- <div class="aboutDiv" id="navDiv">
        <p>Hi, my name is Youssef, I'm 17 years old and diving head first in to the world of development. I like to create useful and attractive websites and applications. I enjoy constructing projects with a balance of optimization and aesthetics. </p>
        <p>I have always had a fasincation with computers in general, using them for as long as I can remember, whether it was to watch movies or play games after school. I always wanted to actually understand how the software works, and make my own games and programs, so I decided to learn. I started learning HTML and CSS in early 2018 and began my journey!</p>
        <p>Currently web development is my main focus, but I intend to learn C# and Swift to develop across multiple platforms and create useful applications. So far, I am completely self taught besides a few Udemy courses I bought to get me up and running.</p>
        <p>Besides programming, I love supporting Arsenal, the best soccer/football team in England. I also play video games in my downtime, mainly RPGs and MOBA's.</p>

        <p> An essential to web development, some might call me a HTML5 master.</p>
        <img src="resources/css3.svg" alt="">
        <p>Styling is an important part of web development. An ugly website is pretty much the same thing as an unusable website. I generally like to use my own CSS but do use Bootstrap as well.</p>
        <img src="resources/git.svg" alt="">
        <p>A great skill to have and use when collaborating with others. I have yet to use it with a team in practice, but I do have 2 computers I program on so I have used it a ton.</p>
        <p>I love learning, figuring out ways to get around my obstacles. The sense of that kind of accomplishment is what I live for.</p>
